# Product Requirements Documentation Generation

This document outlines the process and methodology used to generate comprehensive product requirements documentation for HyprOne's domain model.

## Overview

Product requirements documents (PRDs) were systematically generated for each sub-domain identified in the HyprOne domain model (`docs/domain/domains.md`). These documents follow a standardized template and structure to ensure consistency and completeness across all domains.

This is a multi tenant SaaS Application keep this in context at all times.

## Generation Process

### 1. Source Material

The product requirements were generated based on:
- **Domain Model**: The primary source was `docs/domain/domains.md`, which defines all domains and sub-domains using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles
- **Sub-domain Descriptions**: Each sub-domain in the domain model includes a list of key capabilities and responsibilities
- **Domain Relationships**: Understanding how domains interact with each other to ensure proper integration points

### 2. Document Structure

Each product requirements document follows a consistent structure with the following sections in order:

#### **Overview**
- High-level description of the sub-domain
- Purpose and role within the HyprOne platform
- Context within the broader domain architecture
- Typically 2-3 paragraphs explaining what the sub-domain does and why it exists

#### **Goals & Objectives**
- Primary business goals (bullet list)
- Key objectives the sub-domain aims to achieve
- Success outcomes expected
- Typically 4-6 bullet points

#### **Key Features**
- Core functionality areas (bullet list with bold feature names)
- Major capabilities provided
- Feature categories with brief descriptions
- Format: `- **Feature Name**: Brief description`
- Typically 3-5 key features

#### **User Stories**
- Persona-based user stories following the format: "As a [role], I want [capability] so that [benefit]"
- Covers multiple user personas (marketers, analysts, developers, administrators, privacy officers, etc.)
- Numbered list format: `1. **As a [role]**, I want [capability] so that [benefit].`
- Typically 5-7 user stories per sub-domain

#### **Acceptance Criteria**
- Detailed acceptance criteria for each key feature
- Organized by feature with numbered sub-items
- Includes performance targets, SLAs, and quality metrics
- Format: `1. **Feature Name**` followed by bullet points with specific criteria
- Each criterion should be measurable and testable

#### **Functional Requirements**
- Detailed functional requirements using SHALL statements
- Numbered as FR1, FR2, FR3, etc.
- Each FR covers a major functional area
- Format: `### FR1: Feature Area Name`
- Requirements use "System SHALL" language for mandatory requirements
- May include sub-bullets for detailed specifications
- Typically 5-8 functional requirement areas

**Example Structure:**
```
### FR1: Feature Area Name
- System SHALL [requirement statement]
- System SHALL [requirement statement]
  - Sub-requirement detail
  - Sub-requirement detail
```

#### **Non-Functional Requirements**
- Comprehensive non-functional requirements organized by category
- Numbered as NFR1, NFR2, NFR3, etc.
- Each NFR category covers a specific quality attribute
- Format: `### NFR1: Category Name`
- Requirements use "System SHALL" language
- Includes specific metrics, targets, and thresholds

**Standard NFR Categories (include all that apply):**

**NFR1: Performance**
- Throughput requirements (events/second, requests/second, records/minute)
- Latency targets (response times, processing times)
- Percentile targets (95th percentile, 99th percentile)
- Specific metrics with units and targets
- Example: `- Event ingestion throughput: 100,000 events/second per tenant`
- Example: `- Event processing latency: <500ms (95th percentile)`

**NFR2: Scalability**
- Horizontal scaling capabilities
- Multi-tenant support requirements
- Peak traffic handling (e.g., "3x normal load")
- Data volume handling (e.g., "1,000+ records per tenant")

- Example: `- System SHALL handle peak traffic spikes (3x normal load)`

**NFR3: Reliability**
- Uptime targets (e.g., "99.9% uptime")
- Delivery guarantees (at-least-once, exactly-once, at-most-once)
- Data replay capabilities
- Recovery scenarios
- Fault tolerance requirements
- Example: `- System SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime for ingestion endpoints`
- Example: `- System SHALL guarantee at-least-once delivery for events`

**NFR4: Security**

## Best Practices

### Requirement Writing Guidelines

1. **Use SHALL for Mandatory Requirements**: All functional and non-functional requirements must use "System SHALL" language to indicate mandatory behavior

2. **Be Specific with Metrics**: 
   - Include units (events/second, milliseconds, percentage)
   - Specify percentiles where applicable (95th percentile, 99th percentile)
   - Include both targets and legal maximums
   - Example: `- Event processing latency: <500ms (95th percentile)`

3. **Always Include Core NFRs**:
   - **Performance (NFR1)**: Required for all domains - include throughput, latency, response times
   - **Scalability (NFR2)**: Required for all domains - include horizontal scaling, multi-tenant support, peak load
   - **Security (NFR4)**: Required for all domains - include authentication, encryption, access control
   - **Reliability (NFR3)**: Required for critical/data-intensive domains - include uptime, delivery guarantees

4. **Make Acceptance Criteria Measurable**: 
   - Use specific numbers and thresholds
   - Include time-based targets
   - Define success conditions clearly

5. **Link Success Metrics to Goals**: 
   - Each goal should have corresponding success metrics
   - Metrics should be trackable and measurable
   - Include target values

### Document Maintenance

1. **Keep Requirements Updated**: As the product evolves, update the requirements to reflect current state
2. **Maintain Consistency**: Follow the established structure and naming conventions
3. **Cross-Reference**: Link related requirements and maintain domain relationships
4. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review requirements for accuracy and completeness
5. **Track Changes**: Document significant changes and rationale
